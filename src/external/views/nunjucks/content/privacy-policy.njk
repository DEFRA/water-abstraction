        The Environment Agency runs the Manage your water abstraction or
        impoundment licence service. Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/personal-information-charter">personal information charter</a> explains how we deal with your information.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why we ask for your email address</h3>
      <p>We ask you to tell us your email address for three reasons.</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>
          <p>To create a secure online account for you</p>
          <p>You will need to enter your email address every time you sign in
          to use the service. We will send you some emails as part of the account
          creation process. These emails will include some web links that include
          tracking codes. We use these to track responses to our emails, but we
          will not use them to gather or store any information about your identity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To contact you about this service</p>
          <p>
          We may need to email you with information about the service: for example,
          when we update this privacy policy. We will not use your email address
          to contact you for marketing purposes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To offer you paperless communication</p>
          <p>
          We will ask if you prefer to receive notifications about your
          licence by post or email. We will then use this method to send
          you notifications if possible. We are in the process of updating
          our IT systems, so you may still receive communication by other
          methods too.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How your email address will be stored</h3>
      <p>
        Your email address will be held in a secure Environment Agency
        database that is only accessed by our service. Your email address
        will remain in this database until you ask us to remove it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How to remove your email address from our database</h3>
      <p>
        To have your email address removed from our database, please
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency#org-contacts">contact the Environment Agency.</a>
